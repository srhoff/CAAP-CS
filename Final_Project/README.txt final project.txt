   * Does the same thing as b_anagram, but sorts it in terms of the number of values a key:value pair has. 
      * Contributors: Nathaniel and Ismael
* Name of function: five_anagrams
   * Outputs all the anagrams that have at least 5 values (words)
      * Contributors: Ismael and Spencer
* Name of function: i_anagram1
   * First half of the first word equals the last half of the second word.  
      * Contributors: Nathaniel, Alyssa, Spencer, Jose
* Name of function: i_anagram2
   * First half of the first word equals the last half of the second word. Also checks that the last half of the first word equals the first half of the second word.
      * Contributors: Nathaniel, Alyssa, Spencer, Jose
* Name of function: anadromes 
   * First half of the first word equals the last half of the second word. Also checks that the last half of the first word equals the first half of the first word.
      * Contributors: Ismael
* Name of function: max_vowels
   * Outputs the anagrams with the largest amount of vowels
      * Contributors: Ismael and Nathaniel

* Concise instructions on how we should run the program and what the results should look like:
1. cd into the directory through the terminal 
2. To call: python projectx.py 
3. Read the options and choose 2,3,4,5,6,7, or 8 to obtain a list of interesting anagrams or choose 1 to receive a list of all anagrams.
                You should receive one of the following:
* A Single Anagram Pair
* A List of Anagrams that Fit the Parameters
* All Anagrams in the 235,000 Word Dictionary
