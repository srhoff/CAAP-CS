  <section> <!-- This is the description of our wonderful, fairly attractive (i'd say a 7/10) CEO -->
      <p class="ceo-description"> Spencer Hoffman is #1 on Tennessee's Rising Business Stars, and as
        such many wonder where he'll go from here. However, in order to
        see where one will go one's past is essential. Spencer Hoffman grew up
        moving every few years, first in New York and eventually ending up in
        rural Tennessee. From there he launched his suprise hit company Arrowhead
        Apparel which prioritized any-body inclusivity and the lowest prices
        (no matter what). Extensively utilizing legal loopholes Spencer built a
        rapidly expanding outdoor-wear commercial empire.
